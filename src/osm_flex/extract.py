    """
    Function to extract geometries and tag info for entires in the OSM file
    matching certain OSM keys, or key-value constraints.
    from an OpenStreetMap osm.pbf file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    osm_path : str or Path
        location of osm.pbf file from which to parse
    geo_type : str
        Type of geometry to extract. One of [points, lines, multipolygons]
    osm_keys : list
        a list with all the osm keys that should be reported as columns in
        the output gdf.
    osm_query : str
        optional. query string of the syntax
        "key='value' (and/or further queries)". If left empty, all objects
        for which the first entry of osm_keys is not Null will be parsed.
        See examples in DICT_CIS_OSM in case of doubt.

    Returns
    -------
    gpd.GeoDataFrame
        A gdf with all results from the osm.pbf file matching the
        specified constraints.

    Note
    ----
    1) The keys that are searchable are specified in the osmconf.ini file.
    Make sure that they exist in the attributes=... paragraph under the
    respective geometry section.
    For example, to extract multipolygons with building='yes',
    building must be in the attributes under
    the [multipolygons] section of the file. You can find it in the same
    folder as the osm_dataloader.py module is located.
    2) OSM keys that have : in their name must be changed to _ in the
    search dict, but not in the osmconf.ini
    E.g. tower:type is called tower_type, since it would interfere with the
    SQL syntax otherwise, but still tower:type in the osmconf.ini
    3) If the osm_query is left empty (None), then all objects will be parsed
    for which the first entry of osm_keys is not Null. E.g. if osm_keys =
    ['building', 'name'] and osm_query = None, then all items matching
    building=* will be parsed.

    pairs are valid.
    https://overpass-turbo.eu/ for a direct visual output of the query,
    and to quickly check the validity. The wizard can help you find the
    correct keys / values you are looking for.
